      Taking the concept design issued by Lynne Hunt interiors, we developed a
      door and wayfinding signage solution. Each unit was supplied with a wall
      mounting bracket for ease of maintenance and installation, was
      individually LED illuminated and featured a bronze frame and bronze laser
      cut, raised lettering.
